# I See OC Health
Do certain factors make an Orange County resident be more aware of their health than others? 

## Our Submission for 2024 UCI Datathon
How important is health to residents of Orange County? Are the hobbies that people can partake in correlated with a greater interest in one's own health? We developed a machine learning model that predicts how likely an Orange County resident is to prioritize their own health with a 77% confidence rate. In addition, we created multiple graphs to visualize the relationship between hobbies and other various external factors.
